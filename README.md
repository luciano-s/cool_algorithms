 - Monte Carlo method to estimate $\pi$
 
 
    Assuming a circumference of radius $r = 1$ limited by a square of side $s = 2$, we can thus define the ratio $C_{area}/S_{area}$ as:
    
    
    \$$
        C_{area} / S_{area} = \pi r^2 / s^2 = \pi / 4
    \$$
    
    
    We then conclude that
    
    \$$
      C_{area} / S_{area} = \pi / 4 => \pi = 4 * C_{area} / S_{area}
    \$$
    
    We can simply sample a few points to estimate the ratio and then use this result to estimate $\pi$ value
